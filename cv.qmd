## Personal Profile

I am a Computer Science B.Eng. student (2025) at Chongqing Univ. of Posts and Telecommunications and an LLM algorithm intern at Li Auto. I currently work on rubric‑based RLVR and LLM clarification (AskBench) with Prof. Lu Cheng (UIC).

My interests include **human‑centered HCI**, **agentic/multi‑step reasoning**, **interpretability/controllability**, **self‑evolving systems**, and **multimodal pipelines**.

## Publications (Under Review)

```{=typst}
#resume-item[
- *When and What to Ask: AskBench and Rubric‑Guided RLVR for LLM Clarification* (first; under review, ACL; PDF: paper.pdf; code: https://github.com/jialeuuz/askbench)
- *RubricHub: A Comprehensive and Highly Discriminative Rubric Dataset via Automated Coarse‑to‑Fine Generation* (second; under review, ACL; PDF: rubrichub.pdf; arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08430)
]
```

## Ongoing Work

```{=typst}
#resume-item[
- *ProcessRubrics* (first; Li Auto) — a process-level rubric learning framework for improving structured reasoning quality through finer-grained supervision.
- *Learning Persona as Behavior* (second; collaboration with Prof. Lu Cheng, UIC) — a behavior-oriented persona learning study aimed at improving persona consistency with robust cross-domain generalization.

## Experience

```{=typst}
#resume-entry(title: [LLM Algorithm Intern],location: [Li Auto, Beijing],date: [Sep 2023 – present],description: [
- #strong[Data Flywheel for Code LLM] — evaluation-centric loop (SFT → evaluate → data build → filtering → back to SFT) to continually raise coding capabilities.
  - Evaluation-first: standardized harnesses and rubrics so harder tasks surface real capability instead of being bottlenecked by today’s noisy, underspecified eval.
  - Linked loops: evaluation feedback drives tougher data construction; the same tooling filters/repairs low-quality samples before feeding them back into SFT.
- #strong[Multi-step Reasoning + Tool Invocation Agent] — code-LLM agent that plans, writes code, and executes tool calls for precise answers.
  - Multi-step reasoning: decomposes complex or debugging asks into structured plans so context is stitched into a single executable query.
  - Tool grounding: integrates code execution and API/function calls for live data or environment actions when pretrained knowledge falls short.
- #strong[MindGPTo (GPT-4o-style multimodal app)] — end-to-end audio + vision system with paralinguistic control, built from scratch with modular FE/BE interfaces.
  - Mode coverage: supports audio→ASR→LLM→TTS, audio2text→TTS, audio2audio, and multimodal audio+image+video→text→TTS workflows.
  - Paralinguistic SFT: audio data pipelines expand beyond laughter/pause to age, gender, compound emotions, emotional actions, and ambient sounds.
