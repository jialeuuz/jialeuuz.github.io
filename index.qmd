::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! I'm Jiale Zhao, a final-year computer science undergraduate at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I am currently an algorithm intern at Li Auto, where I focus on large language model applications.

I plan to begin a PhD in Fall 2026 and am actively preparing my applications. My research interests span corporate finance topics—such as capital structure, corporate governance, and trade credit—and quantitative methods including financial econometrics and stochastic frontier analysis.


## Background

- Sep 2023 – Present: Algorithm Intern, Li Auto, Large Language Model Group
- Sep 2021 – Jun 2025: B.Eng. in Computer Science, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications
- Fall 2026 (planned): PhD studies (applications in progress)
