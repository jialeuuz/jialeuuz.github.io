::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! I'm Jiale Zhao, a final-year computer science undergraduate at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I currently work on rubrics-based reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models during my internship at Li Auto.

I plan to begin a PhD in Fall 2026. My interests center on large language models and applied NLP, including:

- Human–LLM interaction under underspecification: a practical pipeline for data construction, evaluation, realistic benchmarking, and RLVR training; ongoing collaboration with Prof. Lu Cheng (UIC)
- Agent-based LLMs and multi-step reasoning
- Data flywheels and self-improving systems
- Interpretability, safety, and controllability

## Background

- Fall 2026 (planned): PhD studies (applications in progress)
- Sep 2021 – Jun 2025: B.Eng., Computer Science, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications

## Publications

- **[ThinkPilot: Steering Reasoning Models via Automated Think-prefixes Optimization](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.12063)** — co-first author (equal contribution; not first-listed). Under review via ARR for AACL 2025 (ARR average score: 3.5; planning resubmission to ACL 2025 after revisions).

## Selected Projects

- Rubrics-based RL / RLVR Pipeline — a practical end-to-end pipeline spanning data construction, evaluation, realistic benchmarking, and RLVR training; ongoing collaboration with Prof. Lu Cheng (UIC).
- Data Flywheel for Code LLM — an iterative framework centered on evaluation to mass-produce high-quality training and test data (SFT → eval → data generation → filtering → back to SFT) — developed during my internship at Li Auto.
- Multi-step Reasoning + Tool Invocation Agent — constructs SFT data for LLM Q&A, integrates API function calls, and solves complex tasks via multi-step planning — developed during my internship at Li Auto.
- MindGPTo — an end-to-end multimodal app inspired by GPT‑4o with paralinguistic features; built from scratch with modular design and front/back separation — developed during my internship at Li Auto.
