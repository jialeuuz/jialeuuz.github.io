Many of my experiments live on GitHub ([@jialeuuz](https://github.com/jialeuuz)). I am gradually organizing them here so it is easier to follow the threads of my work.

## Projects

- *LLM applications at Li Auto* — internal prototyping focused on aligning large language models with product requirements. (Selected notes and sanitized demos coming soon.)
- *Corporate finance analytics* — exploratory notebooks on capital structure and trade credit data.

## Utilities

- Reproducible data-processing templates for panel datasets.
- Prompt engineering snippets for rapid evaluation of new model baselines.
