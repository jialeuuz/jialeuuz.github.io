This page highlights selected open-source projects and datasets aligned with my LLM research and engineering work. Many more live on GitHub ([@jialeuuz](https://github.com/jialeuuz)) and Hugging Face.

## Projects

- Data Flywheel for Code LLM — iterative SFT/eval/data-generation/data-filtering loop to produce high-quality training and evaluation data at scale.
- Multi-step Reasoning + Tool Invocation Agent — constructs SFT data for Q&A, integrates API function calls, and solves complex tasks via multi-step planning.
- MindGPTo — an end-to-end multimodal application with paralinguistic features; modular architecture with front/back separation and data pipelines.

## Datasets

- ExpressiveSpeech — open bilingual (Chinese–English) expressive speech dataset (~51 hours, ~14k utterances) curated with the DeEAR expressiveness scoring toolkit. Links: Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/ExpressiveSpeech>, project page <https://freedomintelligence.github.io/ExpressiveSpeech/>. I contributed to the dataset and am second author on the associated paper (under review).

## Utilities

- Prompting and evaluation snippets for rapid model baselines
- Lightweight scripts for dataset curation and filtering
- Experiment scaffolds for reproducible runs (Python/PyTorch, LangChain)
